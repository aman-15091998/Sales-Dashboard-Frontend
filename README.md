# Sales Analytics Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Sales Analytics web application where users can analyze the data in a tabular structure featuring filtering, sorting, and pagination. It also includes visual representations of data using bar and line charts.

Hosted Link: [https://sale-dash.netlify.app/](https://sale-dash.netlify.app/) (The backend is hosted on Render so it may take a few seconds to load the data on the first fetch please be patient).

## How to Use

1. Visit the link: [https://sale-dash.netlify.app/](https://sale-dash.netlify.app/)
2. Select any date from the date picker between 10th July 2024 to 7th August 2024 and data will be displayed on the table and charts.
